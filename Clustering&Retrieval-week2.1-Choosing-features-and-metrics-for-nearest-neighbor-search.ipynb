chatigny under different circumstances we have found him to be even tempered thorough and without agenda we believe that he is a fair minded and impartial judge who has appropriate fitness and temperament for the appellate court we believe that a close examination of judge chatignys record in sentencing federal criminal defendants shows that he is appropriately sensitive to the facts of the person before him and the rights of victims of the crimes that have been committed indeed it is our understanding that the government has never filed an appeal from judge chatignys sentencings and that there has only been one defendant who has appealed from an upward departure we are of the strong opinion that judge chatignys record on the bench makes him an outstanding and very qualified candidate seventeen former federal prosecutors who have worked with judge chatigny wrote to the senate judiciary committee that in criminal as well as civil matters judge chatigny has proven himself over the course of 15 years on the bench to be unbiased compassionate and temperatein its 2006 dismissal of charges in the ross case the second circuit judicial council found that judge chatignys actions were not motivated by any bias in favor of ross the prisoner or against the death penalty but only by the judges reasonable perception that the discharge of his own judicial dutyrequired that he take forceful steps on rosss behalf while the judge used strong language there was no misconductin the judges reasonable view the circumstances thrust on him called for unusual action in discharge of judicial duty to ensure the fair resolution of the important proceeding before himchatigny has yet to rule on the appeal of former yale professor james van de velde who had sued the city of new
